# Vertical AI Tools Directory PRD

> **For Hermes:** This is a planning artifact only. Do not implement from this file without a separate execution step.

**Goal:** Build a niche AI tools discovery, evaluation, and monetization platform that helps a specific audience choose the right tools faster, starting with an MVP that can launch quickly on a near-zero-cost stack.

**Architecture:** The product starts as a content-driven discovery platform: structured tool listings, category pages, comparison pages, and editorial reviews. The moat is not the directory itself but the decision-support layer: Chinese-friendly guidance, scenario-based recommendations, and practical comparison content.

**Tech Stack:** Cloudflare Pages, Cloudflare Workers, Neon or Supabase Postgres, Cloudflare R2, Resend, UptimeRobot.

## 1. Product Summary

### 1.1 Product Name
Working name: Vertical AI Tools Directory

### 1.2 One-Sentence Description
A curated AI tools discovery platform that helps a defined user segment quickly find, compare, and choose the right tools for real-world workflows.

### 1.3 Product Positioning
This is not a generic "AI tools list" site. It is a vertical decision-support platform for one audience, one set of use cases, and one language/context advantage.

### 1.4 Recommended Initial Positioning
Start with one narrow segment instead of a general AI catalog. Candidate directions:
- AI tools for Chinese content creators
- AI tools for job seekers and students
- AI tools for indie hackers and small teams
- AI tools for cross-border sellers and marketers

Recommended default for MVP:
- AI tools for Chinese content creators and operators

Reason:
- User pain is clear
- Tool usage is frequent
- Comparison intent is strong
- Content and SEO opportunities are rich
- Monetization can include affiliate, sponsorship, and consulting/services

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Users interested in AI tools face three problems:
- Too many tools, too little trustworthy guidance
- Generic tool directories do not answer scenario-specific questions
- International reviews often ignore Chinese language support, domestic accessibility, payment friction, and local workflow fit

As a result, users waste time testing tools, choose poor-fit products, or abandon adoption altogether.

---

## 3. Product Vision

Create the most useful Chinese decision-support destination for a targeted class of AI tools by combining:
- structured listings
- honest editorial evaluation
- scenario-based recommendations
- comparison content
- practical onboarding guidance

Long-term, the site should function as:
- a discovery engine for users
- a distribution channel for tool vendors
- a lead-generation and media asset for higher-margin services

## 10. Content Strategy

### 10.1 Launch Content Minimum
Before launch, aim for:
- 30 to 50 tool entries
- 5 to 8 category pages
- 10 comparison pages
- 5 best-of pages
- 1 methodology page explaining evaluation criteria

### 10.2 Editorial Standards
Every tool entry should answer:
- who is this for
- what problem does it solve
- what are the tradeoffs
- what are the realistic alternatives
- what local usage friction exists for Chinese users

### 10.3 Differentiation Rules
Do not publish thin pages that only contain:
- tool logo
- one-line description
- raw feature list
- outbound link

Each page must include actual decision-support value.

### 10.4 SEO Principles
Prioritize long-tail intent pages such as:
- best tools for a scenario
- tool alternatives
- tool comparisons
- pricing and worth-it analysis
- beginner-friendly recommendations

---

Examples:
- featured category slot
- homepage featured block
- newsletter mention
- sponsored review or launch post

Guardrails:
- clearly label sponsorships
- do not compromise overall trust

### 11.3 Phase 3: Lead Generation / Services
Potential services:
- AI tool selection consulting

- private recommendation lists for niche user groups

### 11.4 Phase 4: Newsletter / Media Asset
Build an owned audience for recurring monetization through:
- sponsorships
- curated updates
- premium content later if demand exists

---

## 12. Success Metrics

### 12.1 Product Metrics
- organic landing page count
- average pages per session
- category-to-detail click-through rate

- search usage rate
- email subscription rate

---

## 13. Risks and Mitigations

### 13.1 Risk: Generic Positioning
Risk:
- product becomes another undifferentiated AI directory

Mitigation:
- force narrow audience and scenario focus
- publish locally relevant decision criteria

### 13.2 Risk: Thin SEO Content
Risk:
- search engines treat pages as low-value directory spam

Mitigation:
- require editorial commentary on every important page
- favor fewer high-quality pages over bulk generation

### 13.3 Risk: Low Monetization Despite Traffic
Risk:
- visitors browse but do not convert into revenue

Mitigation:
- prioritize commercial-intent page types early
- add comparison content, alternatives, and explicit CTA paths

### 13.4 Risk: Maintenance Overhead
Risk:
- tools change pricing/features rapidly

Mitigation:
- store `last_updated`
- prioritize high-traffic pages for refreshes
- keep launch corpus intentionally small and curated

### 13.5 Risk: Overbuilding the Product
Risk:
- too much engineering before validating content-market fit

Mitigation:
- build the smallest credible content platform first
- optimize manual workflows before automation

---

## 14. Assumptions

- Organic search will be a primary acquisition channel
- Users care about Chinese support and China accessibility enough to create differentiation
- High-intent comparison content will monetize better than generic listings
- A narrow niche has better odds than a broad AI tools catalog
- Manual curation is acceptable for MVP and preferable to automated low-quality ingestion

---

## 15. Open Questions

These should be resolved before implementation begins:
- Which exact niche should be chosen for launch?
- Should the site prioritize editorial reviews or structured database pages first?
- Is the first monetization target affiliate, paid inclusion, or sponsor leads?
- Should the admin workflow be database-first or headless CMS-first?
- Will email capture be a core CTA from day one or secondary?
- What evaluation framework should be visible to users?

---

## 16. Recommended MVP Launch Sequence

### Phase 0: Positioning Decision
Choose one niche and define:
- target user
- top 3 scenarios
- evaluation criteria
- content thesis

### Phase 1: Content Foundation
Prepare:
- first 30 to 50 tools
- category taxonomy
- first 10 comparison pages
- first 5 scenario pages

### Phase 2: Product Build
Implement:
- directory browsing
- tool detail pages
- search/filtering
- submissions
- click tracking
- basic analytics

### Phase 3: Soft Launch
Launch to:
- niche communities
- social content channels
- founder groups
- direct outreach for tool submissions

### Phase 4: Learn and Iterate
Analyze:
- which page type attracts traffic
- which page type converts clicks
- which category has the strongest interest

Then narrow harder instead of broadening too early.

## 17. Files Likely to Be Created Later During Execution

If the project is implemented, likely artifacts include:
- `docs/prd/vertical-ai-tools-directory.md`
- `docs/ia/vertical-ai-tools-sitemap.md`
- `docs/schema/tool-directory-data-model.md`
- `docs/seo/content-plan.md`
- `docs/launch/mvp-launch-checklist.md`

If implementation happens in a dedicated app repo, the execution plan should define exact app paths separately.

---

## 18. Validation Checklist

A PRD consumer should be able to answer these questions after reading:
- Who exactly is the MVP for?
- Why will users prefer it over a generic AI directory?
- Which pages are in scope for launch?
- What content needs to exist before launch?
- How does the product make money?
- What metrics determine whether to continue?

If any answer is unclear, refine the niche and scope before building.
